# 0x15. API
An API (Application Programming Interface), is a set of rules and protocols
that allows one software application to interact with another.

In this project we are going to write some script that fetch and display data
from an open API called JSONPlaceholder.

## Usage
To use these scripts for most of the cases you need do run the script with an
ID as argument.
```python
python3 name_of_the_script id_of_user
```
